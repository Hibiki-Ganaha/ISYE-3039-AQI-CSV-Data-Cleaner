Statistical analysis project using Python and R on air quality in Atlanta, Macon, Athens, and Americus in Georgia with:
* X-bar charts to examine the stability of the average monthly AQI over time
* R charts to observe the stability of AQI level variability from month to month
* P charts were used to determine the proportion of unhealthy air quality scores recorded, using AQI ≥ 101 as the threshold
* EWMA charts to detect gradual shifts in average AQI in the long-term to analyze trends in air quality across all four cities
